        Are you friends with Kiria? She'd like your help with something.
        A quest exploring Kiria's history, featuring unique mechanics, a challenging battle, and exclusive rewards.

        To begin the quest, Take Kiria to the Eternal Garden with a memory chip and have Mani fix her up.  Once back at home, she may begin to remember something.
        (Any Kiria will work. If you've already fixed her, you may need to use a clone.)
        If the nefia is too difficult, consider selling Fame if you're above 5750.


        Special thanks to
            noa and all of lafrontier for creating Elin and letting add Kiria into the game.
